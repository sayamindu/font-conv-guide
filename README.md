Converting a legacy ASCII based Indic font to an Unicode compliant Open Type Font
===============

This document was written (with financial support from Sarai/CSDS) over 2004-2005.
Most of this document hasn't been updated since then, the only major change has 
been a license change from GFDL to CC-BY-SA (since the latter makes it more easily 
reusable). There may be outdated information in this document - make sure that you 
consult the latest standards, user-guides, etc. before relying on information
provided here.
